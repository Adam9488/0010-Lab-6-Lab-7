# File Information
Our Algorithm prints the word "Something" then asks for a name input. Once the name input is recieved, it outputs "Hello name". It asks for another input phrase. Once that phrase is received, it reverses and uppercases that phrase and prints it out.

# Code of Conduct
We chose our code of conduct to reflect our values in every way. It is effective at explaining our purpose for this simple program, something.py. Any further additions to the project may be documented and adhere to our code of conduct.

# License
Our license is simple and to the point. It was chosen from open-source licensing at opensource.org under the heading of "OSI Approved Licenses". The short length of the license makes it readible. It simply states that redistribution or use of our code must be credited properly. 

We plan on taking legal action if these policies are violated

# Misc
We did not make our own license. We figured it would look more professional if we chose an existing license. This assures us that it is usable and fits any legal requirements. Our code of conduct was adapted from Microsoft Open Source's code of conduct, and changed to fit our specifications. It can be viewed as partially original and partially adopted. We included points in it that establish how we may function if this were an actual corportate code source, and how we may be viewed as a company. It includes different modules for standard "Code of Conducts" found across the web.
